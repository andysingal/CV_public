# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
## Overview
This repository contains a powerful implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) tailored for image recognition tasks. CNNs are a cornerstone of deep learning for computer vision, designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images.

Key Features
Efficient Feature Learning: Utilizes convolution, filters, and pooling techniques to extract and condense essential image features.
Robust Image Translation: Demonstrates resilience to image translations through pooling, preserving crucial information despite minor shifts.
Receptive Field Comprehension: Illustrates how convolution and pooling operations help each cell in the output correspond to patches of the original image.
