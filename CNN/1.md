# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
## Overview
This repository contains a powerful implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) tailored for image recognition tasks. CNNs are a cornerstone of deep learning for computer vision, designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images.

Key Features
Efficient Feature Learning: Utilizes convolution, filters, and pooling techniques to extract and condense essential image features.
Robust Image Translation: Demonstrates resilience to image translations through pooling, preserving crucial information despite minor shifts.
Receptive Field Comprehension: Illustrates how convolution and pooling operations help each cell in the output correspond to patches of the original image.


CNNs and LSTMs – can be cascaded to form a hybrid model that takes in images or video and outputs text. One well-known application of such a hybrid model is image captioning, where the model takes in an image and outputs a plausible textual description of the image.

A CNN-LSTM network architecture consists of a convolutional layer(s) for extracting features from the input data (image), followed by an LSTM layer(s) to perform sequential predictions. This kind of model is both spatially and temporally deep.
