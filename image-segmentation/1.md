In the left half of the preceding diagram, we can see that the image passes through convolution layers,  and that the image size keeps reducing while the number of channels keeps increasing. However, in the right half, we can see that we are upscaling the downscaled image, back to the original height and width but with as many channels as there are classes.

In addition, while upscaling, we are also leveraging information from the corresponding layers in the left half using skip connections so that we can preserve the structure/objects in the original image.

This way, the U-Net architecture learns to preserve the structure (and shapes of objects) of the original image while leveraging the convolution's features to predict the classes that correspond to each pixel.

Task Variants
1. Semantic Segmentation
Semantic Segmentation is the task of segmenting parts of an image that belong to the same class. Semantic Segmentation models make predictions for each pixel and return the probabilities of the classes for each pixel. These models are evaluated on Mean Intersection Over Union (Mean IoU).

2. Instance Segmentation
Instance Segmentation is the variant of Image Segmentation where every distinct object is segmented, instead of one segment per class.

3. Panoptic Segmentation
Panoptic Segmentation is the Image Segmentation task that segments the image both by instance and by class, assigning each pixel a different instance of the class.
