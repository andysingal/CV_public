DeepSORT (Deep Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) is not a part of the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) object detection model, but it is a complementary algorithm often used in conjunction with object detection models like YOLO for multi-object tracking. Let me explain both of these concepts:

<strong>YOLOv8</strong>:
YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a family of real-time object detection algorithms. The "v8" in YOLOv8 refers to a specific version or iteration of the YOLO algorithm. YOLO algorithms are designed to detect and locate objects within images or video frames in real-time. YOLOv8, like its predecessors, divides the image into a grid and predicts the bounding boxes and class probabilities for objects within each grid cell. It's used for object detection tasks.

<strong>DeepSORT</strong>:
DeepSORT is a tracking algorithm, and it stands for "Deep Simple Online and Realtime Tracking." It is not an object detection algorithm but a tracking algorithm. Once you've detected objects in an image or video frame using an object detection model like YOLO, DeepSORT can be used to track these objects over time. It assigns unique IDs to objects, maintains their tracks, and predicts the positions of objects in subsequent frames. It helps to associate objects detected in one frame with objects detected in the next frame, enabling you to track objects as they move through the scene.
